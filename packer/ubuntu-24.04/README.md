# Ubuntu 24.04 Packer Template

This directory contains Packer templates and cloud-init files for building a Proxmox-compatible Ubuntu 24.04 image.

## Acknowledgments

The initial Packer template is adapted from the `Pumba98/proxmox-packer-templates` repository. This project customizes and extends that work for a Proxmox-based automation workflow.
